/**
 * Use this file for JavaScript code that you want to run in the front-end
 * on posts/pages that contain this block.
 *
 * When this file is defined as the value of the `viewScript` property
 * in `block.json` it will be enqueued on the front end of the site.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   "viewScript": "file:./view.js"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you're not making any changes to this file because your project doesn't need any
 * JavaScript running in the front-end, then you should delete this file and remove
 * the `viewScript` property from `block.json`.
